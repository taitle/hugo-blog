## TL;DR:

**In case you are responding to an active incident:**

>There is simply *A LOT* to analyze in terms of forensic artifacts on
Windows systems. The process can take a long time, and slow down the IR
process. Below are some of the artifacts that tends to yield quick results.
>
>**Make sure to switch to offline disk analysis on these tools and point them to the right disk!**
>-   [WinLogOnView](#winlogonview): Which 
    account was logged into? From what IP? For how long? When?
>-   [Autoruns](#autoruns): List out all the
    persistence mechanisms in place
>     -   Do not forget to target the disk you are analyzing with `Analyze Offline System`
>-   [Shimcache (AppCompatCache)](#shimcache-appcompatcache): List of
    executed programs with date
>-   [AMcache](#amcache): Another list of
    programs executed on the system

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What to expect, if you have no experience with Windows forensics:**

>On Unix-like systems, [everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file). This means that even live processes will have a file corresponding to their relevant operations. For instance an `environ` file under the `/proc` pseudo-filesystem having the environment variables specific to that process. This provides an easy access to a lot of valuable information from a forensics perspective.
>
>Unfortunately for us, Windows does not have the same mindset. Even when
certain information sources have a file storing a copy of the same thing, they are usually in a binary format and the information is only accessible via special tools that are able to parse them.
>
>This makes forensics analysis of an offline disk rather more challenging for us for several reasons. One is the availability of the tools. Second is the not guaranteed backwards-compatibility of the tools and the artifacts' existence itself. And third, is the lower probability to `grep` through an entire filesystem for a known IOC and get a hit, due to the binary formats.
>
>Therefore it was necessary to compile this page with the locations of
relevant artifacts and the tools to parse them. Iâ€™ve manually tested
each of the artifacts and the related tools mentioned in this page on Win10 systems.

## Before You Begin

-   **This guide assumes your forensic host runs Windows OS**
-   **Are the disk(s) mounted with correct options?**

    -   **Disk must be mounted in** `Read-Only`

    -   **This can be ensured the following way:**

        -   Switch off `automount` by running `mountvol.exe /N`

        -   Connect disk to Windows (do not mount the disk)

        -   Run `diskpart`

        -   Enter `list volume`

        -   Enter `select volume X` (where X is the correct volume
            number from the previous command)

        -   Enter `att vol set readonly`

        -   Enter `detail vol` and ensure the read-only bit is set

        -   Now you can mount the volume and it will be read-only

        -   Enter `assign letter d` to mount the volume to drive `d`

-   **Is the forensic host using UTC? (it should be, but double-check)**
    -   **On Forensic Host:**
        -   Open up the command line

            -   Display current timezone with: `tzutil /g`

            -   Set the current timezone to UTC: `tzutil /s "UTC"`

        -   It can also be set from the GUI by executing `timedate.cpl`

-   **Make sure your PowerShell session is opened with Administrator
    privileges**

-   **How was the machine used (as far as you know)?**

    -   Is there a Web server, DB, or some other application being
        served? Those applications probably have their own separate logging somewhere. Make sure to take advantage of those.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The essentials
-   **Load the Registry**

    -   Windows registry holds a wealth of valuable information

    -   The first order of business before any analysis should be to
        make the registry of the victim host available for analysis

    -   You can use the
        <a href="#Registry-Explorer" rel="nofollow">Registry Explorer</a>
        tool to load offline registry hives from the disk.

    -   Load the following files with Registry Explorer:

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\Config\SOFTWARE`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\Config\DEFAULT`: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

        -   `D:\Users\<USERNAME>\NTUSER.DAT`: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`

        -   If anything is missing, you might find the backups at:
            `D:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\`

-   **Registry Explorer Tip:**

    -   It has a `Bookmarks` section that contains shortcuts to valuable
        registry hives. But it is triggered separately for each of the
        registry files that is loaded.

    -   To utilize it; first select the hive that you want to explore,
        then check the relevant bookmarks:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Basic Information on Windows Registry**

Quoting from my copy of the [Windows Internals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/resources/windows-internals) with a dusty cover:
>Although most people think of the registry as static data stored on the hard disk, as you'll see in this section, the registry is also a window into various in-memory structures maintained by the Windows executive and kernel.

Windows registry follows pretty much the same structure as filesystem
hierarchies. There are 5 root folders:

-   [**HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/hkey-classes-root-key)

    -   Stores data to associate file extensions with programs, and COM class registration information such as ProgIDs, CLSIDs.

-   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)**

    -   A subkey of `HKEY_USERS`

    -   It contains configuration information for Windows and software
        specific to the currently logged in user. Things such as Control Panel settings can be found here.

-   [**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_(HKLM))

    -   Contains configuration information particular to the computer
        (for any user).

    -   HKLM is actually maintained in memory by the kernel in order to
        map all other subkeys. Applications cannot create any additional
        subkeys.

    -   This hive contains four keys;

        -   `SAM`: contains local user account and local group
            membership information, including their passwords, last
            login dates etc.

        -   `SECURITY`: stores systemwide security policies, and while that sounds important, you'll most likely won't be able to get anything useful out of here.

        -   `SYSTEM`: Stores systemwide configuration necessary to boot the system, like mounted drives, driver database, keyboard layout etc.

        -   `SOFTWARE`: Software specific configuration keys are stored
            here.

    -   These are loaded at boot time from their respective files
        located under the `D:\Windows\System32\config\` folder.

-   HKEY_USERS (HKU)

    -   Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer.

-   HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)

    -   Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by
        the local computer at system startup. Hardware profiles are no longer supported, so this is mostly legacy stuff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Hostname and Domain**

    -   Select `System` registry hive from Registry Explorer.

    -   Select `ComputerName` from the bookmarks.

        -   Or go to the following key manually:
            `System\ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName`

    -   Select `SECURITY` registry hive from Registry Explorer.

    -   Select `Domain Name` from the bookmarks.

        -   Manually go to
            `D:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY:Policy\PolDnDDN`

    -   Alternative:

        -   Check `SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters`

            -   Contains `Domains`, `DHCP` server information,
                `Hostname` etc.

-   **Timezone**

    -   Select `SYSTEM` registry hive from Registry Explorer.

    -   Select `TimeZoneInformation` from the bookmarks

        -   Manually: `SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\TimeZoneInformation`

-   **Usernames and SIDs**

    -   Select `SAM` registry hive from Registry Explorer.

    -   Select `Users` from the bookmarks.

    -   Check `Names` key, or `V` values name

        -   Manually you can check `SAM\Domains\Account\Users`

    -   Mapping SIDs to Usernames:

        -   Windows stores Security identifiers (SIDs) under the
            following registry key:
            `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList`

        -   The Hive key corresponds to the SID. `ProfileImagePath`
            value name contains the username.

-   **Last Login Date, Account Information, Login Count**

    -   If you are only interested in last login date for each user,
        download [RegRipper from this link](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0)

    -   Unzip and execute `rr.exe` (GUI version)

    -   For input, enter `D:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`, and specify
        any location for output

    -   Let it rip, and the output file will contain relevant login
        information for each user

    -   Example output:
		![image-20220228-121924.png](/assets/img/windows-forensics/1575501413.png)

-   **Last Login Date, Login Method, Session Length, and IP Address for
    Remote Connections**

    -   First, learn the location of `Event Logs`

        -   By default it resides at:
            `D:\Windows\system32\winevt\Logs\Application.evtx`

        -   If not, check the following registry key

            -   `SYSTEM:ControlSet001\Services\EventLog\Application\File`

            -   Registry Explorer already has a bookmark of this
                location

            -   Select `SYSTEM` hive, and from the `Bookmarks` menu
                select `EventLog`

    -   Download [WinLogOnView from the link](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/windows_log_on_times_view.html)

        -   Click on `Options` â†’ `Advanced Options`

        -   Change `Data Source` to `External Disk`

        -   Enter the `evtx` folder that youâ€™ve determined in the
            previous step

        -   You will get an output like the following:
        ![image-20220228-121924.png](/assets/img/windows-forensics/1575501410.png)

## Persistence

-   There are dozens of different ways persistence can be achieved on
    Windows systems

-   Checking them manually is a cumbersome process

-   Luckily, `Autoruns` from SysInternals handles this very well,
    including for offline disks

-   **Download** [Autoruns from this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)

    -   If you are using the `GUI`:

        -   Click on `File` and select `Analyze Offline System`

        -   Enter `D:\Windows` as the `System Root` path

        -   It should automatically detect the `Default` profile and
            start to list out persistence mechanisms

            -   You can specify the user profile you want to work on too

        -   If you want, you can try to speed up your analysis process:

            -   Click on `Options` and select `Scan Options`

            -   Check the `Check VirusTotal.com`

            -   **DO NOT** check the `Submit Unknown Images`

                -   If you are dealing with an APT, this would alert them
                    that their sample has been discovered

            -   Now you can filter out all the clean, known Microsoft
                images

    -   If you are using the `CLI`:

        -   `autorunsc.exe -a * -c -h -s '*' -z D:\Windows D:\Users\Default -nobanner`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Autoruns already checks the locations below.**

    -   But if for some reason manual inspection is necessary, below are the most common places.

-   **Scheduled Tasks**

    -   Each `Scheduled Task` can be found as a separate file under:

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\Tasks` or `D:\Windows\SysWow64\Tasks`

-   **StartupInfo**

    -   Located under: `D:\Windows\System32\WDI\LogFiles\StartupInfo\`,
        in the following format: `<USER_SID>/StartupInfo<NUMBER>.xml`

    -   There could be up to 5 per user account. They contain a list of
        processes that were executed within the first 90 seconds from
        the time the user logged in.

    -   The info includes start time, the full command line and the
        parent process info, among other things.

-	**ExplorerStartupLog**

	-	Created when the system boots up, and located at:

		-   `D:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\ExplorerStartupLog.etl`

    -   Can be opened with `Event Viewer`

-   **Run Keys**

    -   Probably the most commonly utilised persistence mechanism

    -   Any program under `Run` key will be executed at each start-up

    -   Whereas `RunOnce` executes it once, and deletes the key

    -   These keys can be found at:

        -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

        -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`

        -   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

        -   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`

    -   `Registry Explorer` can used to access them easily

        -   Just select `Software`, and from the bookmarks go to `Run`
            or `RunOnce`

-   **Start Menu**

    -   Windows uses this folder to store shortcuts to programs to be
        executed on startup

    -   Files are located under:

        -   For `All Users`:

            -   `D:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`

        -   For `Current User`:

            -   `D:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

## Web Server

-   **XAMPP Logs:**

    -   `D:\xampp\apache\logs`

-   **IIS:**

    -   `D:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1`

        -   Note: replace 1 with the number for your IIS website ID

    -   `D:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\W3SVC1`

    -   `D:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR`

    -   In case the logs are not found in the folders above, you can
        check the following config:

        -   `D:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config\ApplicationHost.config`

    -   If there is suspicion of a backdoor/webshell artifact, you can
        do searches such as:

        -   `grep.exe -Er "(ShellExecute|FromBase64String|StartInfo\.FileName|eval)" D:\inetpub\`

        -   `Get-ChildItem -Force -Path D:\inetpub\ -recurse -ea silentlycontinue |  Select-String -Pattern "FromBase64String"`

-   In case there is suspicion of a backdoor in the form of IIS
    modules:

    -   A native IIS module is a dynamic-link library (DLL) written
        using the IIS C++ API.

        -   Native modules are located in the
            `D:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\` folder on the server and can
            be configured for some, or for all, applications hosted by
            the server.

        -   Check
            `%windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\ApplicationHost.config`for the existence of these.

-   **Exchange Web Server:**

    -   By default located under:
        - `$exinstall\Logging\Ews`

    -   At least 14 days of Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs, located
        at `Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\v15\Logging\ECP\Server`

## General Logs and Windows Event Logs

-   **Windows Event Logs**

    -   By default, Windows Event Logs are located under this folder:

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs`

        -   If not, the location can be confirmed from:

            -   `SYSTEM:ControlSet001\Services\EventLog\Application\File`

        -   <a href="#Registry-Explorer" rel="nofollow">Registry Explorer</a>
            already has a bookmark of this location

        -   Select `SYSTEM` hive, and from the `Bookmarks` menu select
            `EventLog`

    -   The log files can then be loaded in with `Event Viewer` tool of
        Windows itself

        -   Run `Event Viewer`

        -   From the `Action` menu on top right, select `Open Saved Log`

        -   Load the desired log file from the folder youâ€™ve located

        -   Alternatively, you can just double click on the log files
            and they will be loaded automatically

        -   `Windows PowerShell`, `Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational`, `System`, `Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager%4Operational` log files might be particularly useful

-   **RDP Logs**

    -   Windows Event Logs also contain RDP related logs

-   **RDP Cache**

    -   `mstsc.exe` is the built-in client that allows connecting to
        remote computers via RDP

    -   It stores an RDP cache with the aim to speed up the connection

    -   This cache contains screenshots of the parts of the screen that
        does not change much

    -   Through this cache, you may be able to find out if the victim
        host was used to connect to other hosts via RDP

        -   `D:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Cache`

        -   [bmc-tools](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/bmc-tools) can be used to extract images from the bin file

-   **User Access Logging**

    -   [It was discovered and documented by DFIR team of KPMG](https://advisory.kpmg.us/blog/2021/digital-forensics-incident-response.html):

        -   `The UAL can be found on Windows Servers (2012 and up) and is a local data aggregation feature, recording client usage by role and product on each system providing the resource.`

        -   `According to Microsoft's documentation these logs will:`

            -   Keep a tally of user requests for local servers,
                physical or virtual

            -   Keep a tally of user requests for local software
                products on these servers

            -   Pull statistics from Hyper-V, regarding high and low
                periods of demand for resources

            -   Pull UAL data from remote servers

    -   Logs are located under `D:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sum`

## Deposited Files & Filesystem Artifacts

-   **LOLBIN Downloaded Files**

    -   `LOLBINs` such as `certutil` are frequently leveraged by
        attackers to download next stages

        -   A list of its capabilities for attackers: [LOLBAS-Certutil](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certutil/)

    -   Files downloaded with `certutil` have a copy of them stored in
        some of the following locations:

        -   `MetaData` folder holds the URL of the each file downloaded,
            while `Content` folder holds the files themselves.

        -   So if you are unsure where a file came from, just open the
            corresponding file in MetaData folder with `strings.exe`, or
            `notepad.exe`.

    -   <div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;">

        <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

-   **Deleted Files**

    -   `D:\$Recycle.Bin` folder contains folders with each usersâ€™ `SID`

        -   Under the usersâ€™ SID there are files which begin with `$I`
            and `$R`

        -   When a file is deleted two files are created:

            -   `$R` file contains the actual file that was deleted

            -   `$I` file contains the metadata of the deleted file

-   **Malicious Hosts Entries**

    -   `Hosts` file can be used to hijack traffic to malicious websites

    -   It takes precedence over DNS queries

    -   It is located at:

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

        -   `D:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\lmhosts.sam`

### Recently Accessed, Created, and Modified Files

-   **Files modified within the past 7 days**

    -   `Get-ChildItem -Force -Path D:\ -Recurse -ea silentlycontinue| ? {$_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)}`

-   **Files accessed within the past 7 days**

    -   `Get-ChildItem -Force -Path D:\ -Recurse -ea silentlycontinue| ? {$_.LastAccessTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)}`

-   **Files created within the past 7 days**

    -   `Get-ChildItem -Force -Path D:\ -Recurse -ea silentlycontinue| ? {$_.CreationTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)}`

## Evidence of Program Execution

### UserAssist

-   A registry key under `NTUSER.DAT` hive

-   It provides a list of **GUI based programs** launched from the
    desktop

-   To examine the data:

    -   First navigate to

        -   `NTUSER.DAT: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist{<GUID>}\Count`

        -   `Registry Explorer` has a bookmark of this location already

            -   Just click on `NTUSER.DAT`, and select `UserAssist` from
                the bookmarks menu

    -   Pick the items with a `Count` greater than `0`

    -   The contents are encoded with `ROT13`

        -   For instance, the value below is decoded to:

            -   `{0139Q44R-6NSR-49S2-8690-3QNSPNR6SSO8}\Npprffbevrf\Favccvat Gbby.yax`

            -   `{0139D44E-6AFE-49F2-8690-3DAFCAE6FFB8}\Accessories\Snipping Tool.lnk`

    -   Alternatively, you can use `RegRipper` to do these steps
        automatically

        -   Download <a href="#" rel="nofollow">RegRipper</a>

        -   Unzip and execute `rr.exe` (GUI version)

        -   For input, enter `D:\Users\<username>\NTUSER.DAT`, and
            specify any location for output

        -   Let it rip, and the output file will contain relevant
            execution history

        -   Search for `UserAssist` in the output file

### Prefetch

-   Prefetching is a system that helps systems boot up and run faster by
    caching needed files ahead of time

-   Prefetch can be very valuable, as it contains the following data:

    -   Name of the executable ran

    -   Unicode list of DLLs used by that executable

    -   Count of how many times the executable has been run

    -   Timestamp indicating the last time the program was executed

-   Prefetch logs are located at `D:\Windows\Prefetch`

-   `WinPrefetchView` can be used to view them, and it supports loading
    them from an external disk for forensic analysis: [nirsoft-win_prefetch_view.html](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/win_prefetch_view.html)

-   Alternatively, `PECmd` from the [Zimmerman-Tools](#zimmerman-tools) can be
    used as well

    -   Simply run the following in the directory that the tools are
        installed in:

        -   `.\PECmd.exe -d D:\Windows\Prefetch --html "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\output"`

### SuperPrefetch

-   Pretty much the same as `Prefetch`, but it is not a substitution for
    it

-   Generates the database files at:

    -   `D:\Windows\Prefetch\Ag*.db`

-   You can use [CrowdResponse](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/community-tools/crowdresponse/) to parse the data

### StartupInfo

- Mentioned earlier for detecting persistence, it gives a glimpse of executed programs

-   Located under: `D:\Windows\System32\WDI\LogFiles\StartupInfo\`,
        in the following format: `<USER_SID>/StartupInfo<NUMBER>.xml`

-   There could be up to 5 per user account. They contain a list of
        processes that were executed within the first 90 seconds from
        the time the user logged in.

-   The info includes start time, the full command line and the
        parent process info, among other things.

### Crash Dumps

-   **Minidumps**

    -   When your computer crashes, Windows generates a `Minidump` that
        can be examined to determine the root cause

    -   These minidump files are placed under:

        -   `D:\Windows\Minidump`

    -   To analyze, refer to the official guide: [MSDN-read-small-memory-dump-file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/read-small-memory-dump-file)

-   **Crash Dumps**

    -   Crash dumps are generated automatically if certain Registry keys
        are set

    -   Analyzing these is not such a straightforward, trivial task, and therefore skipped
        in this guide

    -   These are located under

        -   `D:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\CrashDumps`

        -   `D:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WER\`

### WMI CCM_Recently_Used_Apps

-   [Windows Management Instrumentation](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753534.aspx)(WMI) is a built-in tool

-   Allows admins to manage different Windows environments, including
    remote systems

-   It is a frequently used `LOLBIN`: [LOLBAS-Wmic](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Wmic/)

-   The WMI Repository is a database that stores meta-information and definitions for WMI classes

    -   The logging occurs on the endpoints regardless of the settings
        that are configured on the SCCM server

    -   Can record the path, name, size, associated user name, last used
        time, launch count, and PE metadata of executed files

    -   Located at `D:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\`

    -   Can be parsed with: [github-CCM_RUA_Finder.py](https://github.com/davidpany/WMI_Forensics/blob/master/CCM_RUA_Finder.py)

        -   Simply run
            `CCM_RUA_Finder.py -i D:\windows\system32\wbem\repository\OBJECTS.DATA -o path\to\output.xls`

            -   If the forensic host does not have Python installed, you
                can exfiltrate the files to your own workstation

            -   The `Microsoft Remote Desktop` tool used for RDP
                connections on MacOS devices supports copy-paste

### Shimcache (AppCompatCache)

-   `Windows Application Compatibility Database` is used by Windows to
    identify possible application compatibility challenges with
    executables.

-   It tracks the executablesâ€™ file name, file size, last modified time.

-   Last 1024 programs executed can be found here:

    -   `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache`

    -   `Registry Explorer` has a bookmark of this location

        -   Select `SYSTEM`, and from the bookmarks menu, go to
            `AppCompatCache`

-   Alternatively, [github-mandiant-ShimCacheParser](https://github.com/mandiant/ShimCacheParser) can
    be used to parse the data

    -   Just export the whole `SYSTEM` registry hive, or the
        `AppCompatCache` as a standalone `.reg` file

        -   `Registry Explorer` can be used to export the key

    -   Use the `-i`, or `-r` option respectively

    -   Output will be as follows:

    -   ![image-forensics-shimcache.png](/assets/img/windows-forensics/1575501404.png)

### AMcache

-   `ProgramDataUpdater` (a task associated with the Application
    Experience Service) uses the registry file `Amcache.hve` to store
    data during process creation

-   This registry stores the first execution of a program on the system,
    including portable programs executed from an external storage.

-   It is located at:

    -   `D:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve`

-   To analyze, use [RegRipper](#regripper)

    -   Load the `Amcache.hve` file

    -   Select an output destination, and `Rip`

    -   You will get an output like the following:

    -   ![image-forensics-amcache.png](/assets/img/windows-forensics/1575501401.png)

### Background Activity Moderator

-   The Background Activity Moderator (BAM) is a Windows service that
    Controls activity of background applications. This service exists in
    Windows 10 only.

-   For each user separately, it provides:

    -   Full path of the executable file

    -   Last execution date/time in UTC

-   It is located under the following keys:

    -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\UserSettings\*\*`

    -   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\*\*`

    -   `Registry Explorer` has a bookmark for it

        -   Select `SYSTEM` hive

        -   From the `Bookmarks` menu, select
            `BAM (Background Activity Monitor)`

## Tools

### Registry Explorer

One of the Zimmerman tools, but a particularly useful one that it
deserves its own space.

-   It is able to explore both Live system registry hives, and offline
    ones

-   Has a `Bookmarks` tab with shortcuts to keys with valuable forensic
    artifacts

-   Can be downloaded from: [ericzimmerman.github.io](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)

### Zimmerman Tools

Eric Zimmerman has written plenty of tools and scripts to perform offline
disk analysis.

-   To install them all, follow the instructions at: [ericzimmerman.github.io](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)

    -   Use [backblazeb2-Get-ZimmermanTools.zip](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/EricZimmermanTools/Get-ZimmermanTools.zip) to download all programs at once and to keep your toolset up-to-date

        -   Use **-Dest** to control where the tools ends up, else
            things end up in same directory as the script (recommended!)

### Power Forensics

-   It is an all-inclusive forensics framework written in PowerShell

-   Supports `NTFS` and `FAT` filesystems

-   Although not utilised in this page for any of the artifacts, it is particularly useful for
    filesystem forensics

-   Documentation with available tools: [powerforensics.readthedocs.io](https://powerforensics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### RegRipper

-   It is a powerful and easy to use tool to parse out various
    information from registry files.

-   It comes with a bunch of plugins to parse data from hives such as
    `SAM`, `SOFTWARE`, `NTUSER` etc.

-   Both GUI and CLI versions are available.

-   Download from: [github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0)

### Autoruns

-   It is a Sysinternals tools, officially developed and
    supported by Microsoft

-   It is able to enumerate tons of different persistence mechanisms on Windows

-   It can be executed both via CLI and GUI

-   It is able to perform analysis on offline systems and disks as well

-   Download and manual link: [MSDN-sysinternals-autoruns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)

### WinLogOnView

-   A simple and concise tool by Nirsoft with one goal:

-   `Analyses the security event log of Windows operating system, and detects the date/time that users logged on and logged off. For every time that a user log on/log off to your system, the following information is displayed: Logon ID, User Name, Domain, Computer, Logon Time, Logoff Time, Duration, and network address.`

-   Download from: [nirsoft-windows_log_on_times_view.html](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/windows_log_on_times_view.html)

### THOR

-   THOR lite can scan both a live system or an offline mounted disk for
    IOCs. THOR already comes equipped with its own list of IOCs to scan
    for. But you can add your own stuff too -if your license allows to it-.

-   If you have a `Forensic Lab License`:

    -   Thor Lite can be used on a disk
        `thor64-lite.exe --fsonly -p D:\`

-   If you are using the `LITE` -free- version: [thor-manual-forensic-lab-license](https://thor-manual.nextron-systems.com/en/latest/usage/special-scan-modes.html#forensic-lab-license)

    -   `thor64.exe -a Filescan --intense --norescontrol --nosoft --cross-platform --alldrives -p D:\`

-   In my experience, THOR gave quite some FPs. For instance, on a
    default installation it said some files masquerade as JPGs and that
    they are not actually JPGs:

        ``` java
        MESSAGE: Suspicious file found
        FILE: D:\Windows\servicing\LCU\Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~17763.2565.1.7\amd64_microsoft-windows-f..toragereportservice_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.17763.1697_none_7825694087316827\f\warning.jpg
        REASON_1: YARA rule Cloaked_as_JPG / Detects a non-JPEG file cloaked as
        ```
