      <description>Introduction xv6 is a reimplementation of UNIXv6 for x86 architecture, created by MIT to be used in their Operating System courses. I found it to be an absolutely great course and learned a lot from it. Hence, I wanted to write about it.
In this post, I will explain some of my solutions for the exercise questions posed in Chapter 2 of the booklet, namely the chapter Page Tables. Since the subject is presented extensively in the book, I won&amp;rsquo;t re-write every detail about it.</description>
